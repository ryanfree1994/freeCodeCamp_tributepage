      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Marsha P. Johnson was a Black, transgender womxn leader during the LGBTQ+ rights movement. Ms. Johnson lived in New York City, where she settled in Greenwich Village and became well-known among the LGBTQ+ community for her activism and drag
        performances.</p>
      <p>Ms. Johnson was also one of the first drag queens who was able to attend the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, once the bar opened its doors to womxn. Around this time, the Stonewall Riots of 1969 began at the Stonewall Inn, where
        transgender womxn and drag queens fought back against police raids and violence.</p>
      <p>According to sources, Ms. Johnson was one of the leaders at the Stonewall Riots, with her activism paving the way for the LGBTQ+ civil rights movement. Ms. Johnson participated in Pride parades and established a community of trans and drag
        folx, so that they could feel included and safe in New York City.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, society was not accepting of Ms. Johnson or her beliefs. Ms. Johnson's body was found in the Hudson River in 1992, with the mystery of her death still being a major point of contention in history and among the LGBTQ+
        community.</p>
      <p>Ms. Johnson is still honored today through art, movies, history lessons, and at Pride parades. The death of Ms. Johnson bringsforth the necessity to continue advocating not only for LGBTQ+ rights, but more importantly, the acceptance,
        inclusion, and justice for Black transgener womxn.</p>
