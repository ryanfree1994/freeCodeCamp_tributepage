# freeCodeCamp_tributepage

Creating a tribute page is one of five responsive web challenges provided by freecodecamp.org. Here is a link to the challenge: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page

The focus of the challenge was to develop a responsive, web page that follows CSS and responsive web best practices. The challenge needed to pass 10 tests, which can be viewed in Codepen: https://codepen.io/ryanfreeland/pen/ZEWVexJ

My challenge passed all 10 tests and is compatible across Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera browsers. I included JavaScript to continue building my skills, as well as to provide greater interactivity and dynamic loading.

I paid tribute to Marsha P. Johnson, as Black womxn have paved the way for many LGBTQ+ folx and it is important to make this distinction.
